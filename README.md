# 🧸 Lady Gurumi's AidanBot

Welcome to **Lady Gurumi’s AidanBot** — a snuggly support assistant powered by GPT-3.5 and infused with plushie wisdom, yarn-based wit, and cat fur (optional, but inevitable).
I created this repo to upload my MIT GenAI Course Assignment 3.1 - "Building a Sales And Support Agent with LangChain".
Please, be kind, I am learning 💜

This Streamlit app answers all your frequently asked questions about <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lady__gurumi">Lady Gurumi</a>’s handmade amigurumi plushies — including returns, shipping, materials, and the emotional state of Batman.


## ✨ Features

- 💬 Scrollable chat interface that keeps your cozy convo in view
- 🧶 Uses LangChain to search pre-written answers in `support_qa.txt`
- 🤖 Powered by GPT-3.5 via OpenAI
- 🎀 Fully styled with pastel flair and a hand-drawn banner
- 📦 Local dev server OR deployable on Streamlit Cloud
