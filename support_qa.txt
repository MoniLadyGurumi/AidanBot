### 🛍️ What’s your return policy? Can I frog it and send it back?
Absolutely! You may return any unused amigurumi (still in its original snuggle-wrap) within 30 days. Just don’t let your cat slobber on it first. Returns are accepted via owl, warp gate, or USPS.

### ⏳ How long will it take for my squishy nerd plushie to arrive?
We ship faster than a warp jump to Vulcan. Domestic orders take 3–5 business days. International shipping varies by dimension, time zone, and your local wizard postmaster, but usually 7–14 days.

### 🎁 Do you offer free shipping or do I have to sacrifice a yarn ball to the gods?
Free shipping kicks in for all U.S. orders over $75. No yarn sacrifices required — though bonus points if you light a scented candle shaped like Totoro.

### 🧹 Can I cancel my order before it's whisked away by crochet elves?
You have a 12-hour cancellation window (or until I hit "summon shipping dragon"). After that, it’s probably already flying your way.

### 🤖 How do I talk to a real human and not a cute AI with yarn for brains?
If the bot is being a bit too squishy-minded, you can reach the human behind the hook at support@ladygurumi.com. You can also DM her on Instagram (@lady__gurumi). She is online Mon–Fri, 9am–6pm EST — unless she is in a yarn coma.

### 🧶 What materials do you use for these magical plushies?
Our creations are crocheted with hypoallergenic cotton and polyester stuffing. Sometimes a bit of wool sneaks in when we’re crafting eldritch bunnies or chaotic neutral hamsters.

### 🌎 Where are your plushies conjured?
Everything is handmade with cozy spells and Simply Lemonade in Metro Atlanta, Georgia. No factory clones — just one magical Moni, two mischievous cats, and an overworked AI named Aidan.

### 💌 Do you take custom orders? I want a Cthulhu in a Pikachu onesie.
As much as I’d love to stitch that abomination into existence, I’m not accepting custom orders right now. The crochet dungeon is booked solid until after DragonCon.

### 🧟 What if my plushie arrives maimed or zombified?
If your cutie arrives looking like it lost a battle with Bowser, email me within 7 days (with pics and order number). I’ll either send a replacement or cast a resurrection spell.

### 🧘‍♀️ What happens if I just want to talk about amigurumi, AI, or how emotionally unavailable Batman is?
You're always welcome to reach out with nerdy questions or emotional support rants. Moni is not a therapist, but she *does* crochet little therapists you can hug.

### 🚀 Do you sell your creations at DragonCon?
YES! DragonCon is our annual market of chaos, joy, and lemonade. We have an overstuffed con table and a dream, so I am sure there you'll find something you cannot resist. If you missed us this year, follow @lady__gurumi for sneak peeks and countdowns.

### 🧾 What forms of payment do you accept at your booth?
Cash, card, Apple Pay, and promises made in good faith. We accept all major credit cards and digital payments — though a pocket full of gold Galleons wouldn’t hurt.

### 🐾 Are your plushies safe for babies or pets?
These cuties are handmade collectibles — not rated for baby teething or dragon chewing. We avoid plastic bits (except for the eyes and occasional mouths), but we can’t guarantee they’ll survive your toddler’s wrath or your cat’s betrayal. Hug gently, snuggle often, and keep away from chaotic gremlins.

### ✨ Can I preorder or reserve a plushie for pick-up?
Nope, sorry! It's first-come, first-snuggle. We restock each con day, so your dream plushie might just be waiting for you tomorrow. The thrill of the hunt is part of the experience — like Pokémon, but fluffier.

### 🧙‍♂️ What kind of plushies do you usually make?
Expect weird frogs, cursed cuties, fandom mashups, eldritch creatures, and the occasional marshmallow man. If it’s odd, adorable, or slightly unhinged — chances are we’ve crocheted it. Our booth is like a loot box for plushie lovers with a sense of humor.

### 🧼 How do I clean my amigurumi if it gets dirty?
Spot clean with a damp cloth and whisper sweet nothings while doing it. Hand-wash gently in cold water and lay flat to dry — no dryers unless you want a felted monster. Don’t bleach. Don’t iron. Don’t scold them for being mischievous.

### 🐱 Are your plushies hypoallergenic?
Most yarns we use are hypoallergenic, but we do work in a home with two cats and a LOT of fiber. If you’re extremely sensitive, send a message to Moni and she’ll let you know what yarns were used in a specific plushie. Archie and La Purri inspect every plushie. They shed love. And maybe a little fur.
